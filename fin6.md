 ## interest rates and bond valuation
 
 ## learning goals
 1) identify important bond features and types of bonds
 2) describe bond values and why they fluctuate
 3) discuss bond ratings and what they mean
 4) evaluate impact of inflation on interest rates
 5) explain term structure of interest rates and determinants of bond yields
 
  ## bonds and bond valuation
  * bonds are debt securities that a corporation or government issues when they wish to borrow money from the public on a long term basis
  * bond is normally an interest-only loan (borrower pays interest every period, and none of principal will be repaid until end of loan)
  * coupons are the regular interest payments
  * face value/par value is the amount that will be repaid at the end of the loan
  * maturity is the number of years until face value is paid
  * YTM (yield to maturity) is the market interest rate.
  
  ```
  Bond value = C * [1-1/(1+r)^t]/r + F/(1+r)^t
  = present value of coupons + present value of the face amount
  = annuity present value + present value of the face amount
  ```
   
   * bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions. If interest rates rise, bond's value declines. 
   * interest rate risk is the fluctuating interest rates that determine how sensitive its price is to interest rate changes
   * two things that determine sensitiveity
   1) time to maturity: longer the time to maturity, greater the interest rate risk
   2) coupon rate: lower the coupon rate, greater the interest rate risk
