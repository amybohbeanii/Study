## leverage and capital structure

## learning goals
1) discuss effect of financial leverage
2) analyze impact of taxes and baankruptcy on capital structure choice
3) identify essentials of bankruptcy process

* capital restructurings: alter firms existing capital structure. 
* assets of firm are not directly affected, so it can be considered in isolation from investment decisions.
* value of firm is maximized when WACC is minimized. therefore, we choose firms capital structure so WACC is minimized
* one capital structure is better or its the optimal capital structure/ target capital structure than another if it results in a lower WACC

## effect of financial leverage
* financial leverage is the extent to which firm relies on debt
* effect of financial leverage depends on company's EBIT. when EBIT is high, leverage is beneficial. 
* capital structure is important because of the impact it has on expected return to stockholders and riskiness of the stock
* homemade leverage: use of personal borrowing to alter degree of financial leverage
* it doesnt matter/makes no difference if compan adopts proposed capital structure to stockholder because he can use homemmade leverage

## capital structure and cost of equity capital
* nothing special about corporate borrowing because investors can borrow or lend on their own. 
* M&M proposition 1 states its completely irrelevant how a firm chooses to arrange its finances "size of pie doesnt depend on how its sliced"
* M*M proposition 2: cost of equity depends on 3 things 
1) required rate of return on firm's assets
2) firm's cost of debt
3) firm's debt-equity ratio
* cost of equity capital R(e) = R(a) + (R(a)-R(d)) * (D/E), R(a) being the required return on firms assets
1) business risk: risk inherent in firm's operations determined by firm's assets and operations
2) financial risk: extra risk arising from debt financing (R(a)-R(d) * (D/E)) determined by financial policy

 ## corporate taxes and capital structure
 * interest paid on debt is tax deductible (benefit to debt financing)
 * failure to meet debt obligations results in bankruptcy (cost of debt financing)
 * interest tax shield: tax savings
 * once we include taxes, capital structure definitely matters.
 
 ## bankruptcy
 * when firm is unable to pay bondholders, then ownership of firm's assets transferrs from stockholders to bondholders
 * equity has no value when value of firm's assets equals value of debt
 * direct bankruptcy costs: legal and administrative expenses associated with bankrupty proceeding
 * indirect bankruptcy costs: to avoid a bankrupty filing
 * financial distress costs: generic term for direct and indirect costs associated with going bankrupt and or avoiding a bankruptcy filing
 
  ## bankruptcy
  * legal proceeding for liquidating (selling off assets of firm) or reoganzing a business (issuing new securities to replace old securities)
