## financial statements, taxes, cash flows

## learning goals
1) diff b/t book value and market value
2) diff b/t accounting income and cash fllow
3) diff b/t average and marginal tax rates
4) determine CF from financial statements

## balance sheet is snapshot of firm
 * organizes/summarizes firm's assets (owns) and liabilities (owes) and the diff b/t two, the equity at given pt in time
 * assets = liabilities + shareholders' equity
 * three things that matter when examing balance sheet
 1) liquidity
 2) debt vs equity
 3) market value vs book value
 
 * assets are current or fixed
 * current has life of less than 1 year. Normally converst to cash within 12 months. ex: cash, accounts receivable (money owed to firm by customers)
 * fixed has a long life
 1) can be tangible (truck, compmuter)
 2) intangible (trademark, patent)
 
 * liabilities
 * current or long term
 * current liabilities have life less than 1 year (meaning they must be paid within 1 year). ex: accounts payable (money firm owes to suppliers)
 * long term liabilities like a loan firm will pay off in 5 years. bonds (long term debt) and bondholders (long-term creditors)
 
 * shareholders' equity/common equity/owners' equity
 
 
 ## net working capital 
 * net working capital = current assets - current liabilities
 * positive in a healthy firm
 
 ## liquidity
  * speed and ease an asset can be converted to cash
  * ex: gold is relatively liquid. custom manufacturing facility is not. 
  * a highly liquid asset is one that can be quickly sold without significant loss of value. 
  * illiquid asset is one that cannot be quickly converted to cash without substantial price reductioni
  * most liquid assets listed first
  * for current assets, invesntory is least liquid
  * fixed assets are illiquid
  * liquidity is valuable. More liquid business, then less likely it is to experience financial distress.
  * liquid assets are less profitable to hold. Cash for example just sits there.
  * tradeoff between advantages of liquidity and forgone potential profits. 
  
  ## debt vs equity
  
  ## financial leverage is the use of debt in firm's capital structure
  * financial leveaage can increase the potential reward to shareholders and also potential for financial distress and business failure...
  
  
  ## market value vs book value
   * true value of any asset is market value AKA cash get if sold 
   * book values are values on balance sheet and generally not what asset is worth AKA historical cost
   * market value is not on balance sheet
   * no necessary connection b/t total assets shown on balance sheet and market value of firm. Most valuable assets of firm might be
   1) good management
   2) good reputation
   3) talented employees
   4) brand name (Coca-Cola, Microsoft, IBM )
   
   *goal of financial manager is to increase market value of the stock
   
  ## income statement
  * performance over period of time, usually quarter or year
  * revenues - expenses = income
  * last item is net income and often expressed as earnings per share (EPS)
  * retained earnings = net income - cash dividends
  * EPS = NI/total shares outstanding
  * dividends per share = total dividends/total shares outstanding
  * figures may not be represenative of actual CF that occured during a particular period...
  
  ## recognition principle and matching principle is recognize revenue and costs at same time
  
  ## primary reason accounting income differs from CF is income satement contains noncash items
  * depreciation causes problems
  * financial manager cares about actual timing of cash inflows and outflows to come up with reasonable estimate of market value, so we have to separate cash flows from noncash accounting entries.
  
  ## short run vs long run
  * long run business costs are vaiable
  
  ## earnings management is a controversial practice for firms to overstate or understate earnings at various times to smooth out dips and surges in earnings
  
  ## taxes
   * one of largest cash outflows
   * results of political not economic forces
   * size of tax bill is determied through tax code, often amended set of rules
   * partnerships and proprietorships computed using personal income tax schdules. 
  
  ## average vs marginal tax rates
   * average tax rate = percentage of income that goes to taxes
   * marginal tax rate is extra tax you paid if you earned one more dollar
   * flat rate tax is having only one tax rate. Corporate taxation in US is based on modified flaat rate tax, which becomes a true flat rate for highest incomes
 
 ## marginal tax rates goes down and is the  relevant noe for financial decisioin making
  * large corp, we can assume the average and margnal tax rates of 35%
  
  ## cash flow
  * dont confused with financial accounting's statement of cash flows
  ```
  cash flow from assets = cash flow to creditors + cash flow to stockholders (or owners of firm if not a corp)
  ```
