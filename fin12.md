 ## cost of capital
  * this chaapter brings together earlier chapters dealing with stocks and bonds, capital budgeting, risk and return
  * understand how to determine required return on proposed investment
  
 ## learning goals
 1) determine firm's cost of equity capital
 2) determine firm's cost of debt
 3) determine firm's overall cost of capital
 4) identify pitfalls associated with firm's overall cost of capital and what to do about it
 5) what firm's cost of capital means to firm and investors
 
  * WACC = weighted averaged cost of capital, is the min return a company needs to earn to satisfy all of its investors, including stockholders, bondholders, preferred stockholders. 
  * WACC is the required return on the overall firm. 
  * taxes are important to detemine required retuurn on investment because we want to value the aftertax cash flows from project
  * project has positive NPV only when return exceeds what financial markets offer on investments of similar risk.
  
  ## cost of capital
  required return/discount rate/cost of capital all the same
  * cost of capital depends on the use of the funds, not the source
  * a firm's cost of capital reflects both its cost of debt capital and its cost of equity capital
  * cost of capital is a mixture of the returns needed to compensate its creditors and stockholders
  
  ## Cost of equity
  * no direct way of obsering the return the firm's equity investors require on their investment. instead two ways to estimate
  1) dividend growth model approach (easiest way to estiamte)
  2) SML approach
  
  dividend growth model (Ch7) price per share of the stock P(0) = D(1) / R(E) -  g
  g is constant rate growth, D(1) is next period's projected dividend, R(E) for rewquired return on stock
  
   * rearranged to solve for R(E) = D(1)/P(0) + g, R(E) is return that shareholders require on stock
   * dividend growth only applicable to companies that pay dividends
   * no direct adjustment for riskiness of investment
   
   * SML approach R(E) = R(f) + B(e) * (R(m)-R(f))
   * downsides is you have to estimate market risk premium and the beta 
   
   ## cost of debt and preferred stock 
   * cost of debt = return firm's creditors demad on new borrowing
   * can be observed directly or indirectly, because its the interest rate the firm must pay on new borrowing. same as the YTM
   * cost of preferred stock is a perpetuity (a fixed dividend paid every period forrever) R(p) = D/P(0), d is fixed dividend and P(0) is current price per share of preferred stock
   
   ## WACC
   * overall return the firm must earn on its existing assets to maintain the value of its stock
   ```
   WACC = (E/V) * R(e) + (D/V) * R(d) * (1-T(c))
   
   if firm uses preferred stock in capital structure, then (E/V)*R(e) + (P/V)*R(p) + (D/V) * R(d) * (1-T(c)), R(p) being the cost of preferred stock
   
   ## divisional and project costs of capital
    * if evaluating investments with risks substantially diff from overall firm, dont use WACC
    * have separate divisional costs of capital if its has more than one line of business
    * determine ost of capital for investments similar in the marketplace
    * pure play is compay that focuses on single line of business
    * pure play appracoh is to estimate required return using pure plays
