 ## making capital investment decisions
 
## learning goals
1) determine relevant cash flows for proposed investment
2) analyze project's projected cash flows
3) evaluate estimated NPV, specifically the sensitiveity of NPV estimates to assumptions made about the uncertain future


 ## project cash flows - which ones are relevant and which are not?
  * incremental cash flows: the relevant cash flows that change or increment the firm's existing cash flow and are a direct consequence of taking the project
  * stand-alone principle: the project's resulting cash flows. Isolated from other projects or activities
  
 ## incremental cash flows
  * sunk cost: cost which has already been paid or have already incurred the liability to pay. Cost cannot be changed by the decision to accept/reject a project. Make sure to exclude from analysis
  
  ## opportunity costs
  * give up valuable opportunity to do somethign else with it
  
  ## side effects
  * erosion: sales might come at the expense of other projects/products. cash flows from new line should be adjusted downward to reflect lost profits on other lines

 ## net working capital
  * project usually requires firm invests in net working capital (cash on hand to pay expenses that arise) in addition to long term assets
  
  ## financing costs
  * when analyzing proposed investment, we don include interest paid, and other financing costs liek dividends or principal repaid (since we are only interested in cash flow generated by assets of the project) 
  * interest paid is a cash flow to creditors, not cash flow from assets
  
   ## pro forma financial statements and project cash flows
   * need to summarize relevant info for project. 
   1) sales
   2) selling price per unit
   3) variable costs per unit
   4) fixed costs
   5) depretiation and life
   6) initial investment in net working capital 
   7) tax rate
   
   * remember not to deduct any interest expense
   
   ## cashh flow analysis

 ## project net working capital
 
   * forecasting risk/estimation risk: is the errors made in projected cash flows
   * sources of value: pinpointing to something specific if the new product is better than competition
  1) can we manufacture at lower cost?
  2) distribute more effectively?
  3) identify undeveloped market niches?
  4) gain control of a market?
  
   ## What if analysis/ scenario analysis
   * goal is to assess the degree of forecasting risk... identify components most critical to the success or failure of an investment
   1) first step is find the base case: estimate NPV for project based on projected cash flows
   2) investigate impact of diff assumptions on future of estimates by putting an upper or lower bound on various components of project
   
    ## sensitivity analysis
    * freeze all variables except one then see how sensitive estimate of NPV is to changes in that one variable
    * steeper the line, greater the sensitivity of NPV when plotted on a graph.
    
     ## managerial options and capital budgeting -- this is more like project planning
     * managerial options: opportunities in the future to modify a project
     * for example: a product can be  priced, manufactured, advertised, produced, can all be changed.
     * contingency planning: actioins to take if something occurs (relates to managerial options)
     * some options: expand, abandon, wait
     * capital rationing: profitable investments available but we can't get the needed funds to undertake them.
     * soft rationing: allocation of fixed amount of money
     * hard rationing: cannot raise capital for project
