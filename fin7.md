 ## equity markets and stock valuation
 
 ## learning goals
 1) assess how stock prices depend on future dividends and dividend growth
 2) identify diff ways corporate directors are elected to office
 3) explain how stock markets work
 
  * common and preferred stock is another major source of financing for corporations
  
  ## common stock valuation
  * common stock has no maturity.
 
  to determine present value of a stock today use this formula..
  ```
  present value = (D1 + P1)/(1+R), D is dividend at end of period, P1 is price in one period, and R is required return
  ```
  
   * generally, the price of stock today is equal to present value of all of the future dividends. there can be infinite number of future dividends.
   * to come up with value for stock, some assumptions has to be made about the pattern of future dividends
   1) special case where dividend has a 0 growth rate (like a preferred stock)..D is constant 
   2) dividend grows at constant rate / growing perpetuity
   3) dividend grows at nonconstant rate
   
   ```
   case 1: P (0) = D/R  
   because the dividend is always the same, stock is an ordinary perpetuity with cash flow equal to D every period
   case 2: D(t) = D(0)*(1+g)^t
   steady growth iin dividends is an explicit goal under firm's divdend policy
   dividend growth model = P(t) = D(t)*(1+g)/(R-g) 
   case 3: look at examples.
   ```
   
    * use dividend growth model to get price of the stock in partcular year...
   
   ## valuation using comparables
    * for stocks that dont pay dividends, we can still value usig PE ratio or price-sales ratio
    ```
    P(t) = Benchmark PE ratio * EPS(t)
    P(t) = Benchmark price-sales ratio * sales per share (t)
    ```
    
     * required return, R = D(1)/P(0)+g
     * D(1)/P(0) is dividend yield and g is capital gains uield 


 ## features of common stock
  * no special preferene when dividends are paid or when firm goes into bankruptcy
  * general idea is one share, one vote. Directors elected at annual shareholders meeting by a vote of the holders of majority of shares.
  * straight voting (vote director one at a time. the only way to guarantee seat is to own 50%+. Cumulative voting is to permit minority participation)
  * proxy is grant of authority by shareholder to someone else to vote that shareholder's shares
  * proxy fight is the battle when a group of shareholders try to obtain votes via proxy in attempt to replace management by electing enough directors
  * special classes of stock that are created with unequal voting rights. Purpose has to with contorling firm.
  * rights of shareholders:
  1) vote for directors
  2) right to dividends paid (dividends are at discretion of BOD)
  3) right to assets remaining after liabilities have been paid
  4) right to vote on merger
  5) preemptive right (right to any new stock sold. New stock must first be offered to existing shareholders before offering to public)
  
 ## features of preferred stock
  * preference over common stock in payment of dividends and distribution of assets in event of liquidation. Preferred stock sometimes has no voting privileges. 
  
 ## stock markets
  * most security transactions involve dealers and brokers
  * dealer: maintains inventory and stands ready to buy and sell at any time (used car dealer, university bookstore is primary and secondary market textbook dealer)
  * broker: brings the buyers and sellers together, but doesnt maintain inventory (real estate broker)
  * the price the dealer is willing to pay is called bid price
  * price dealer will sell is ask price.
  * spread price is the dealer's profits and is the diff between bid and ask price
  * NYSE is the largest stock market in the world measured in terms of total value of shares listed
  * NASDAQ is bigger in terms of number of companies listed (3.1k) and number of shares trade. Has about a dozen market makers
  * NYSE Euronext became world's first global exchange...
  * electronic trading is the way to buy and sell on exchange. For orders not handled electronically NYSE relies on license holders (40k per year)
  * 3 license holders
  1) designated market makers (DMM): specialists in particular stocks. Continually posts and updates bid and ask prices.
  2) floor brokers: executes trades for customers
  3) supplemental liquidity providers (SLPs)
  
  * order flow is the flow of customer orders to buy and sell stocks
  * customers of NYSE are millions of individual investors, tens of thousands of institutional investors. More than one billion shares change hands in a single day
  * NASDAQ has three levels of information access: Lvl1 is accurate source of price quotations, Lvl2 is inside quotes the highest bid quotes and lowest asked quotes for listed security, Lvl3 is for market makers only
  * NASDAQ has three separate markets: Global Select, Global Market, Capital Market
