 ## working with financial statements
 
 ## learning goals
  * standardize financial statements for comparison purposes
  * compute common ratios
  * determine firm's profitability and growth
  * identify problems/pitfalls in financial statement analysis
  
  ## we need to standardize finaancial statements
 by using percentages instead of dollars by using common-size statements
 
  ## common-size balance sheets
  * each item is a percentage of total assets
  
  ## common-size income statements
  * each item is a perccentage of total sales
  
  ## ratio analysis
  * another way to compare companies of diff sizes 
  * problem is ppl dont compute in same way and this leads to confusion
  
  ## short term solvency (liquidity) ratios
   * primary concern is firm's ability to pay its bills over short run without undue stress, so these ratios focus on current assets and liabilities
   * adv is the book and market values tend to be similar because they're current and dont live long enough to differ.
   ```
   current ratio = current assets/current liabilities
   1.31 times = $708/$540
   ```
   
   * higher the current ratio, the better. High ratio means liquidity but also may indicate inefficient use of cash and other short term assets.
   * CA less than 1 means net working capital is negative.
   
   ```
   quick ratio = current assets-inventory/current liabilities
   .53 times = $708-422/$540
   ```
   
   ```
   cash ratio = cash/current liabilities
   ```
   
   
  ## long term solvency (financial leverage) ratios
   * ratios intended to address firm's ability to meet obligations in long run.
   
  ```
  total debt ratio = total assets - total equity / total assets
  .28 times = $3588-2591/3588
  ```
  
  * this number, high or low, depends on capital strucutre 
  * firm uses 28% debt or $.28 inn debt for every $1 in assets, or $.72 in equity for every $.28 in debt
  
  ```
  2 variation of total debt ratio:
  
  debt-equity ratio = total debt/total equity
  .38 times = .28/.72
  
  equity multiplier = total assets/total equity
  1.38 times = 1/.72
  ```
   * equity multiplier is also 1 + debt-equity ratio
   * given one, can calculate other two. so its all the same thing.
   
  ```
   times interest earned/interest coverage ratio = EBIT/Interest
   4.9 times = $691/$141
  ```
  * how well its interest obligations are covered

  ## profitability ratios
  
  ## market value ratios
