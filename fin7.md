 ## equity markets and stock valuation
 
 ## learning goals
 1) assess how stock prices depend on future dividends and dividend growth
 2) identify diff ways corporate directors are elected to office
 3) explain how stock markets work
 
  * common and preferred stock is another major source of financing for corporations
  
  ## common stock valuation
  * common stock has no maturity.
 
  to determine present value of a stock today use this formula..
  ```
  present value = (D1 + P1)/(1+R), D is dividend at end of period, P1 is price in one period, and R is required return
  ```
  
   * generally, the price of stock today is equal to present value of all of the future dividends. there can be infinite number of future dividends.
   * to come up with value for stock, some assumptions has to be made about the pattern of future dividends
   1) special case where dividend has a 0 growth rate (like a preferred stock)..D is constant 
   2) dividend grows at constant rate / growing perpetuity
   3) dividend grows at nonconstant rate
   
   ```
   case 1: P (0) = D/R  
   because the dividend is always the same, stock is an ordinary perpetuity with cash flow equal to D every period
   case 2: D(t) = D(0)*(1+g)^t
   steady growth iin dividends is an explicit goal under firm's divdend policy
   dividend growth model = P(t) = D(t)*(1+g)/(R-g) 
   case 3: look at examples.
   ```
   
    * use dividend growth model to get price of the stock in partcular year...
    ## valuation using comparables
    * for stocks that dont pay dividends, we can still value usig PE ratio or price-sales ratio
    ```
    P(t) = Benchmark PE ratio * EPS(t)
    P(t) = Benchmark price-sales ratio * sales per share (t)
    ```
    
     * required return, R = D(1)/P(0)+g
     * D(1)/P(0) is dividend yield and g is capital gains uield
