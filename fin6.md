 ## interest rates and bond valuation
 
 ## learning goals
 1) identify important bond features and types of bonds
 2) describe bond values and why they fluctuate
 3) discuss bond ratings and what they mean
 4) evaluate impact of inflation on interest rates
 5) explain term structure of interest rates and determinants of bond yields
 
  ## bonds and bond valuation
  * bonds are vital source of financing to governments and corporations.
  * bonds are debt securities that a corporation or government issues when they wish to borrow money from the public on a long term basis
  * bond is normally an interest-only loan (borrower pays interest every period, and none of principal will be repaid until end of loan)
  * coupons are the regular interest payments
  * face value/par value is the amount that will be repaid at the end of the loan
  * maturity is the number of years until face value is paid
  * YTM (yield to maturity) is the market interest rate.
  
  ```
  Bond value = C * [1-1/(1+r)^t]/r + F/(1+r)^t
  = present value of coupons + present value of the face amount
  = annuity present value + present value of the face amount
  ```
   
   * bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions. If interest rates rise, bond's value declines. 
   * interest rate risk is the fluctuating interest rates that determine how sensitive its price is to interest rate changes
   * two things that determine sensitiveity
   1) time to maturity: longer the time to maturity, greater the interest rate risk
   2) coupon rate: lower the coupon rate, greater the interest rate risk

 ## More on bond features
  * bond = long term debt
  * equity securities/debt securities are issued by corporations
  * person/firm making loan is the creditor/lender
  * corporation borrowing money is the debtor/borrower
  * debt is not ownership interest in firm. Creditors dont have voting power. 
  * equity is ownership interest. Equity holders are paid after debt holders.
  * unpaid debt is liability of firm. If not paid, creditors can legally claim assets of firm. One of costs of issuing debt is possibility of financial failure. 
  * indenture is written agreement between corporation (borrower) and creditors
  
  ## indenture includes
  1) terms of bond
  2) total amount of bonds issued
  3) descriptioini of  property used as security
  4) repayment arrangements
  5) call provisions
  6) details of protective covenants
  
  ## bond ratings
   * firms pay to have their debt rated. the two leading bond rating firms are Moodys and S&P
   
   ## diff types of bonds
   
   ## gov bonds
   * Treasury issues have no default risk and are exempt from state income taxes
   * municipal notes and bonds have varying degrees of default risk and are exempt from state and federal income taxes (attractive to high income, high tax bracket investors)
   
   ## zero coupon bonds
   * bonds that pays no coupons must be offered at price much lower than stated value
   
   ## floating rate bonds
   * TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities)
   
   ## bond markets
   * trading volume in bonds on typical day is much larger than stocks (amount of money that changes hands)
   * The largest securities market in the world is not the NYSE, its the US Treasury market
   
   * reason bond markets are larger is because a large corporation typically has one common stock issue outstnding. Whereas, there is a sozen or more note and bond issues outstanding.
   * beyond corporations, the federal, state, and local borrowing is enormous
   * no centralized reporting of bond transactions like the NYSE
   
   * clean price is the quoted price of bond
   * dirty price is with the accrued interest and the price you actually pay
   
   ## inflation and interest rates
   * real rates vs nominal rates
   * nominal rates have not been adjusted for inflation. real rates have been.
   ```
   nominal rate on investment is the percentage change in the number of dollars you have
   real ratae on an investment is the percentage change in how much you can buy with your dollars, in other words, the percentage change in your buying power
   ```
   * fisher effect 
   
   ```
   given nominal rate or real rate AND the inflation rate, we can calc either real or nominal rate
   R is nominal rate, r is real rate, h is inflation rate
   1+R = (1+r)*(1+h)
   ```
   
   ## determinants of bond yields
    * term structure of interest rates = relationship between short and long term interest rates
    * inflation premium is the extra compensation for loss 
    * interest rate risk premium is the extra compensation for loss
    * to determine appropriate yield on bond
    1) real rate of interest
    2) expected future inflation
    3) interest rate risk
    4) default risk
    5) taxability
    6) lack of liquidity
