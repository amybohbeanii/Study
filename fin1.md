 ### investments
  * What determines price of a sharae of stock or a financial asset?
  * Potential risks and rewards in investing in financial assets?
  * best mix of the diff types of financial assets to hold?
  
  * ppl usually become a stockbrker at large companies (Merril Lynch) advising customers on types of investmets to consider and to help customers make buy/sell decisioins. 
  * or become financial advisor
  * or portfolio manager, who manages money for investors. Individual investors frequently buy into mutual funds. Those funds are invested by a portfolio manager. They also manage money for pension funds, insurance companies, and other types of institutions. 
  * or security analysis, who researches individual investments, such as stock in a particular company and determines if the price is right. Analyst will dive deep into company and industry reports, along with other information sources. Brokers and portfolio managers rely on security analysts for info and recommendations. (IMO, coolest role)
  
  ### financial institutions
  * bank's commercial loan officer evaluates whether business has strong financial position to warrent extendig a loan
  * insurance company's analyst decides if a particular risk is suitable for insurance and what the premium should be
  
 ### international finance
 * portfolio and security analysts specialzie in non US companies, or have extensive overseas operations, need employees familiar with international topics such as exchange rates and political risk. Banks might make loans across country lines, so a role is international sepcialists. 
 
 ## business finance
 * if I start own business I need to know
 1) What long term investments should I take on? What buildings, machinery, and equipment do I need?
 2) How to get long term financing to pay for investments? Will I borrow money or bring in other owners?
 3) How to manage everyday financial activities such as collecting from customers and paying suppliers? 
 
 ## financial manager

 ## financial management decisions
 1) capital budgeting: process of planning and managing firm's long term investments by identifying investment opportunities AKA cash flow generated by asset exceeds cost of that asset. Concern with size, timing, and risk of future CFs
 2) capital structure: the mix of long term debt and equity the firm uses to finance its operations
 * How much should firm borrow?
 * Least expensive sources of funds for the firm?
 3) working capital management: day to day activity that ensures firm has sufficient resources to continue its operatiosn and avoiod costly interruptions. 
 * How much cash and inventory to keep on hand?
 * Sell on credit to customers?
 * How to obtain needed short term financing?
 
 ### Business organizations
 * disadvantages of sole prioprietorships and partnerships: 
 * central problem is the ability of business to grow bc of inability to raise cash for investment
 1) unlimited liability for business debts on owners
 2) limited life of business
 3) difficulty transferrign ownership
 * advantages of corps
 * easiness to raise cash
 1) ease of transfer ownership
 2) limited liability for business debts
 3) unlimited life of business
 
 ## Sole Proprietorship
  * business owned by 1 person. 
  * least regulated, so this type of business is prevalent. Many businesses that become large corps start as small proprietorships
  * owner of sole proprietorship keeps all profits. 
  * Downside: owner has unlimited liability for business debts. Creditors can look to proprietor's personal assets for payment
  * life is limited to owner's life span. Transfer of ownership is difficult - requires the sale of entire business to new owner.
  * Limitation: amount of equity that can be raised is limited to proprietor's personal wealth. Business is unable to exploit new opportunities because of insufficient capital. 
 
 ## Partnership
  * adv/disadv similar to sole
  * 2 more owners. 
  * partnership terminates if sell out or dies
  * all income taxed as personal income and amount of equity raised is limited to combined wealth
 ### general partnership
  * all partners share gains and losses as described in partnership agreement. Can be informal and formal
  * all partners have unlimited liability for all partnership debts. 
 
 ### limited partnership
  * one or more general partners that runs business and has unlimited liability, but one or more limited partners who doesnt actively participate in business
  * common in real estate ventures. The limited partner's liability for business debts is limited to amount that partner contributes to partnership
  
 ## Corporation
  * large forms (IBM, Apple, are almost all organized as corporations
  * corp has rights, duties, privileges of actual person
  * corp can borrow money and own property. 
  * can sue and be sued. enter contracts
  * own stock in another corp
  * needs charter (articles of incorporation which includes name, life, business purpose, number of shares that can be issued) and bylaws (rules for how corp is regulated. ex: how directors are elected. stockholders can amend bylaws)
  * stockholders elect Board of Directors, who select managers. Managers run corp's affairs in regards to stockholders' interests. In principle, stockholders control the corp.
  * life is not limited because ownershi (through share of stocks) can be readily transferred
  * stockholders has limited liability for corporate debts. most stockholder loses is what they invest. Corp borrows money in its own name
 * if new equity is needed, it can sell new shares of stock and attract new investors
 * number of owners can be huge. large corps can of thousands/millions of stockholders. Ex: GE has 10 billioin shares and 4 million shareholders.
 * huge advantage:  double taxation!!! Corp is legal person so tax once. when money is paid out to investors its taxed again at personal level
 
 ## LLC (limited liability company)
 * goal is to operated and be taxed like partnership but retain limited liability for owners.
 * hybridg of partnership and corporation
 * IRS (internal revenue service) gets to say if its LLC or corporation
 
 ## goal of financial managementment 
 * profit maximizaion is too general... theres a short term versus long term issue
 * goal of financial managment is to maximize current value per share of the existing stock. Same thing as maximizing market price per share.
 * (if no traded stock) maximize the market value of the existing owners' equity
 * the fundamenal question is, from stockholders point of view, whats a good financial managemet decision?
 * assumption is stockholders buy stock to gain financiallyy, then good financial decisioins increase the value of the stock
 
 ## dont be unethical...Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) 
  * response to corporate scandals involving Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Adelphia
  * companies must tell truth in financial statements. Maagement is personally responsible for the accuracy of a company's financial statements
  * is offshoring ethical?
  * is relocating businesses ethical?
  * is insourcing jobs ethical?
  * many companies decided to go dark meaning their shares are no longer traded in major stock markets. The law eliminated public disclosure instead of improving it... Sarbox compliance costs are high...
  
  ## agency relationship is the relationship b/t stockholders and management
  * exist whenever theres separation of ownership and management
  * agency problem is the conflict of interest between the principal (stockholder) and the agent (management)
  * to avoid agency problem maybe give agent 10% of sale instead of flat fee so agent's incentive is not just to make a sale but to get you the best price
  * firms that are poorly managed are more attractive as acquititions. Avoiding takeover by another firm gives management an incentive to act in stockholders interest
  ## proxy fight is when unhappy stockholders act to replace existing management
  
  ## stakeholders (parties with a financial interest (claim on the CF) in the firm)
  * management
  * stockholders
  * employees
  * customers
  * suppliers
  * government
 
 ## financial markets bring buyers and sellers
  * primary and secondary markets , debt and equity securities
  * primary market: original sale of securities by gov and corporationis
  * secondary market are securities bought and sold after original sale
  * equity is sold solely by corp
  * debt securities issued by corp and gov
 
 ## primary market
 * corp is seller. 
 * transaction makes money for corp. two types:
 1) public offering: selling securities to general public. must be registered with SEC (Securities and Exchange commission)
 * to avoid expensve of public offerings, debt and equity are often sold privately to large financial institutioins such as l ife insurance companies or mutual funds
 2) private placements: negotiated sale involving specific buyer
 
 ## secondary
 * provides means for transferring ownership of corporate securities
 * two kinds 
 1) auction markets
  * physical locatioin.
  * matches buyers and sellers
  * equity share trade mostly in organized auction markets, like NYSE (accounts for 85% of all shares traded in auctiom markets
 2) dealer markets/over the counter (OTC) markets
  * buy and sell for themselves
  * connected electronically
  * NASDAQ, more companies listed compared to NYSE but smaller companies and trades less actively also total value is less
