### Chapter 13: Leverage and Capital Structure

## capital structure
* Capital structure: debt relative to equity decision chosen by a firm
* its about striking the right balance between debt and equity (debt-equity ratio from ch1 is a capital structure decision
* capital structure is just a reflection of a firm's borrowing policy (borrow alot or little?)
* can choose any structure
* capital structure decision.financial structure can be examined separately from other activities (since assets are not affected). 
* capital structure decisions can have important implications for value of firm and its cost of capital.
* precise measure is not obtainable. Therefore, the question of what is the best capital structure for a firm at a time is incomplete/unclear
* Choose a capital structure so that WACC is minimized. 
* To compare capital structures, one capital structure is better than another if it has a lower WACC
* optimal/target capital structure is the one with the lowest possible WACC.

## capital restructurings
* when a firm substritutes one capital structure for another while leaving firm's assets unchanged. 
* decisions for capital restructuring can be considered in isolation from investment decisions. (This is the difference between financing and investing decisions)

## debt financing
* debt can be beneficial to the firm though the more debt a firm has, greater the risk of bankruptcy
* two sides:
1) many firms/individuals are far too conservative in their use of debt.
2) firms/individuals too heavily indebted

## debt-equity ratio
* to increase ratio, a firm can issue some bonds, use proceeds to buy back some stock.
* to decrease ratio, a firm can issue some stock, use proceeds to pay off some debt.
* these activities to alter the existing capital structre is called capital restructurings
* To choose a debt-equity ratio, the principle is to choose action that maximizes the value of a share of stock or essetially maximize value of the whole firm/firm value.

## cost of capital
* what happens to WACC (Weighted average cost of capital ch12) or cost of capital when we vary amount of debt financing/debt-equity ratio
* WACC tells us that the value of firm is maximized, when WACC is minimized. (minimize WACC maximizes value of firm's cash flows)
