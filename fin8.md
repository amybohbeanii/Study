 ## Net Present Value and other investment criteria
  * this chapter deals with capital budgeting decision. What long term investments should we make?
  * should we launch a new product or enter a new market?
  * huge number of possible investments, each option is either valuable or not.
  * this chpt has techniciques to analyze potential business ventures to decide which are worth undertaking
  
  ## learning goals
  1) summarize payback rule and its shortcomings
  2) discuss accounting rates of return and problems with them
  3) explain internal rate of return criterion and its strength and weakness
  4) evaluate proposed investments by using NPV 
  5) apply modifid internal rate of return
  6) calculate profitability index and its relation to NPV
  
   ## NPV
   * always preferred because other alternatives to assessing profitability has flaws
   * investment must be worth more in the marketplace than it costs to acquire. 
   * capital budgeting is figuring out whether a proposed investment or project will be worth more thanit costs once its in place
   * NPV is the diff between investment's market value and its cost. Measure of how much value is created or added today by undertaking an investment
   * capital budgeting is searching for investments with positive NPV (flipping a house)
   * Theress risk, b/c estimates may not turn out to be correct
   * theres the problem of estimating the value of an investment using only indirect market information (esp with emerging tech, this is hard to find comparabe)
   * How to estimate value of business without comparables?
   1) estimate future cash flows the business is expected to produce. Then NPV is the diff b/t the present value of future cash flows and cost of investment. This is just discounted cash flow/DCF valuation
   2) accept is NPV is positive. If its 0, then indifferent between taking investment or not
   
   ```
   given cash revenues of $20k per year, assuming every goes expected. Costs including taxes of 14K per year. Business is 8 years. PPE is worth 2k at salvage. Project costs 30k to launch. 15% discount rate on new projects. Is this good investmet?
   There are 1k shares of stock outstanding, whats the effect on price per share from taking the investment?
   
   basically means 8 year annuity of 6k per year with single lump sum inflow of 2k in 8 years
   1) calc present value = 6k * (1-1/1.15^8)/.15 + 2k/1.15^8
   = 6k * 4.48 + 2k/3.05
   = 27,578
   2) calc NPV = -30k + 27,578 = -$2,422 REJECT!!
   
   ** this sounds easy, but its the difficulty of coming up with the cash flows and discount rate
   ```
   
    ## payback rule
    * payback: length of time it takes to recover initial investment. 
    * payback period: is just number of years
    * used by large companies because many minor decisions dont warrant a detailed analysis because cost of analysis exceeds possible loss from a mistake 
    * Based on payback rule, an investment is acceptable if its calculated payback peiod is less than some prespecifieid number of years
    * a rapid payback does not guarantee a good investment... also there may be more than one payback period
    * severe shortcomings. 
    1) no discounting involved so time value of money is ignored. 
    2) fails to consider risk differences
    3) number is arbitratily chosen for the payback cutoff
    4) by ignoring cash flows beyond cutoff, profitable long term inestments may be rejected
    5) payack tend to bias us towards shorter term investments
    
    ## average accounting return (AAR)
    ```
    average net income/average book value
    ```
     * based on average accounting return rule, project is acceptable if its average accounting return exceeds target average accounting return.
     * huge drawback: its the ratio of two accounting number, and not comparable to return offers in financial markets
     * it doesnt even look at the right things: cash flow and market value
     
    ## Internal rate of return (IRR)
     * its "internal" rate depends on the cash flows of the particular investment
     * IRR rule: an investment is acceptable if IRR exceeds the required return.
     * IRR on an investment is the required return that results in a 0 NPV when it is used as the discont rate
     * problem with calculating IRR is when cash flows are not conventional (cash flows are not all positive) or when trying to compare 2 or more investments
     
     ## modified internal rate of return (MIRR)
     1) discounting approach
     2) reinvestment approach
     3) combination approach
     
     ## profitability index (PI) / benefit-cost ratio
      * measures "bang for the buck" the value created per dollar invested.
      * measure of performance when capital is scarce, it might make sense to allocate to projects with highest PIs
      * similar to NPV, but rely on NPV rather than PI
      
      ## the purpose of alternatives
      * true NPV is unknown. alternatives helps assess whether estimated NPV is reliable
      * we need multiple criteria to evaluate a proposal
      * for example: payback and AAR are consistent with conclusion that  NPV is positive.
