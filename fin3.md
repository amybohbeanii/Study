 ## working with financial statements
 
 ## learning goals
  * standardize financial statements for comparison purposes
  * compute common ratios
  * determine firm's profitability and growth
  * identify problems/pitfalls in financial statement analysis
  
  ## we need to standardize finaancial statements
 by using percentages instead of dollars by using common-size statements
 
  ## common-size balance sheets
  * each item is a percentage of total assets
  
  ## common-size income statements
  * each item is a perccentage of total sales
  
  ## ratio analysis
  * another way to compare companies of diff sizes 
  * problem is ppl dont compute in same way and this leads to confusion
  
  ## short term solvency (liquidity) ratios
   * primary concern is firm's ability to pay its bills over short run without undue stress, so these ratios focus on current assets and liabilities
   * adv is the book and market values tend to be similar because they're current and dont live long enough to differ.
   ```
   current ratio = current assets/current liabilities
   1.31 times = $708/$540
   ```
   
   * higher the current ratio, the better. High ratio means liquidity but also may indicate inefficient use of cash and other short term assets.
   * CA less than 1 means net working capital is negative.
   
   ```
   quick ratio = current assets-inventory/current liabilities
   .53 times = $708-422/$540
   ```
   
   ```
   cash ratio = cash/current liabilities
   ```
   
   
  ## long term solvency (financial leverage) ratios
   * ratios intended to address firm's ability to meet obligations in long run.
   
  ```
  total debt ratio = total assets - total equity / total assets
  .28 times = $3588-2591/3588
  ```
  
  * this number, high or low, depends on capital strucutre 
  * firm uses 28% debt or $.28 inn debt for every $1 in assets, or $.72 in equity for every $.28 in debt
  
  ```
  2 variation of total debt ratio:
  
  debt-equity ratio = total debt/total equity
  .38 times = .28/.72
  
  equity multiplier = total assets/total equity
  1.38 times = 1/.72
  ```
   * equity multiplier is also 1 + debt-equity ratio
   * given one, can calculate other two. so its all the same thing.
   
  ```
   times interest earned/interest coverage ratio = EBIT/Interest
   4.9 times = $691/$141
  ```
  * how well its interest obligations are covered
  
  
  
  ## asset management (turnover) / asset utilization ratios
   * efficiency of using assets to generate sales
   * two important current assets: inventory and receivables
   
  ```
  inventory turnover = cost of goods sold/inventory
  3.2 times = $1,344/$422
  ```
  * the higher number, the more efficiently the inventory is being managed
  * this ratio lets us calc average days sales in inventory
  * how fast we can sell products
  ```
   days sales in invetory = 365/inventory turnover
   115 days = 365/3.2
  ```
   * inventory sits 115 days on average before its sold.
  
  ```
  receivables turnover = sales/ accounts receivable
  12.3 times = $2,311/$188
  ```
  
   * how fast we can colelct on sales
   * collect outstanding credit accounts and reloaned the money 12.3 times during the year
   * might make more sense if converted to days
   
   ```
   days' sales in receivables = 365 days/receivables turnovers
   30 days = 365/12.3
   ```
    * on average, credit sales is collected in 30 days.
    * also called average collection period (ACP)
    
    ```
    payables turnover = COGS/accounts payable
    3.9 times = $1,344/$344
    
    days' costs in payables 365/3.9 = 94 days. 
    ```
    
     * average, takes 95 days to pay. Creditor cares about this
     
    ```
    total asset turnover = sales / total assets
    .64 times = $2,311/$3,588
    ```
    
     * big picture ratio. For every dollar, .64 was generated in sales
     * high or low is good or bad
