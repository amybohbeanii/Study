 ## lessons from capital market history
  * greater the potential reward from risky investment, greater the risk
  * this chapter is about the relation between risk and return
  * practical info for thinking about investing in financial assets (stocks, bonds)
  * specifically, what rate you should expect moeny to grow per year
  * risky investments
  * what capital market history can tell us about risk and return
  
  ## learning goals
  1) calc return on investment
  2) discuss historical returns and risks on varioius important types of invesments
  3) assess implications of market efficiency
  
  * greater the risk, greater the return. 
  * How to measure amount of risk in investment?
  * whats a high return? 
  
   ## returns
   * return on investment: is the gain or loss from the investment/asset you buy
   * two components of return
   1) income component: cash
   2) value of asset: capital gain or loss on investment
   
    ## percentage returns
    ```
    dividend yield = D(t+1)/P(t)
    =$.185/37 = .05 = 5%
   for every dollar we invest, we get five cents in dividends
   
   capital gains yield = P(t+1)-P(t)/P(t)
   =$40.33-37/37
   =9%
   for every dollar we invest, we get nine cents in capital gains
   
   percentage return is 14 cents on the dollar or 14%
    ```
    
    ## historical records on rates of return on five important types of financial investments
    1) large-company stocks (S&P's 500 index)
    2) small-company stocks (smallest 20% of companies listed on NYSE)
    3) long-term corporate bonds (bonds with 20 years to maturity)
    4) long-term US gov bonds (20 years to maturity)
    5) US treasury bills (one month maturity)

 * small-company did the best overall but was erratic.
 * long term gov bonds and treasury bills grew more steady but slowly
 * treasury bills are also predictable

 ## average returns - historical record
 1) large stocks - 12.1% avg return, 8.6% risk premium
 2) small stocks - 16.7%; 13.2%
 3) long-term corp bonds - 6.4%; 2.9%
 4) long-term gov bonds - 6.1%; 2.6%
 5) US treasury bills - 3.5%; risk free
 6) Inflation  3%
 
 * real rate on treasury bills was .5% per year
 
 ## risk premiums
  * gov can raise taxes to pay its bills, so T-bills have risk-free return. Other spectrum is common stocks which are very risky. Stock of a large US corporatioin has about average risk compared to all risky assets
  * risk premium: a reward for breaking risk
  
  ## variability of returns
  * measures of volatity (how far actual return deviates from the avg)
  * larger the numbers, the mpread out the returns will be.
  1) variance: average squared diff between actual returns and the average return. Bigger the number, the more actual returns tend to differ from avg return
  2) standard deviation
  
  ![Image of role](https://github.com/amybohbeanii/Study/blob/master/variance.png)
  1) variance = .027/(4-1) = .009
  2) SD = square root of .009 = .09487
  
  ![Image of role](https://github.com/amybohbeanii/Study/blob/master/distribution.png)
  * normal distribution: probability of ending up in given range
 
  * a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds might suffer, but the losses would be much smaller than those experienced by an all stock portfolio (2008)
  
  ## arithmetic versus geometric averages
  * arithmetic average return: what you earn in a particular year
  * geometric average return: average compound return per year over a particular period, always smaller
  * arithmetic avg return is probably too high for longer periods, and geo. too low for shortter periods.
  * 15-20 years or less arithmetic, 40+ years use geometric
  
  ```
  if we have T years of returns,
  geometric average return = (1+R(1)) * (1+R(2)) * ... * (1+R(t))^(1/t) - 1
  
  or if given graph below, convert arithmetic is geometric..
  arithmetic - (variance/2) = geometric
  ```

  ## capital market efficiency
  * all expected returns are compensation for risk
  * a market is efficient when prices adjust quickly and correctly when new information arrives
  * efficient capital market: current market prices fully reflect available info
  
![Image of role](https://github.com/amybohbeanii/Study/blob/master/reaction.png)

 * efficient market hypothesis (EMH): well organized markets such as NYSE are efficient markets. While inefficiencies may exist, they are relatively small and not common
 * three forms of market efficiency
 1) weak form efficient: reflects past prices
 2) semistrong form efficient: all public info is reflected in stock price
 3) strong form efficient: all info of every kind is reflected in stock prices
